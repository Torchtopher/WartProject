This project was made beacuase I wanted more resources in Minecraft. It is made in python. It is still being worked on and plenty of new features are on the way. This program was made for windows and for a 2560x1440 monitor with a decent computer. Withen minecraft you must also have a certain type of farm and be using a certain texture pack. It will most likely not work for you but thats ok.

Features:

OCR to detect your position and move based on that.
Random actions to simulate human behavior.
Color detection to detect disconects and rejoin and to prevent getting stuck.
Records at 5 fps for debugging/seeing uptime
Decent logging, no log file yet but the terminal output gives a good idea whats going on.

Installing:

Don't, there are probably 3 people who would actually benift from this. The repo is just for version control and sharing with friends.

Why its better than most other autofarmers.

Its written in python so unlike most autofarmers which are in java and actually get the position of blocks/the player every tick this just uses the screen so it makes it (hopefully) very very hard to detect, and certainly harder to detect than the java mods. It also has features that has it take breaks from farming to simulate humans having to go to the bathroom/do something beside farm.

TODO:

Add website with login, make it look really nice. Make it connected with the bot so you can semi control it from the website.
Use the OCR on your invetory to see how much you have farmed.
Add more random actions (Mouse actions)
Add command line args and make it more customizable.
Make code async/write it better.
Add the feature to make sure its farming, and if its not take action.
Make discord bot connected with all this, to notify me when it goes offline/gets disconnected
Make some cool graphs of how much the bot farmed.
Learn JavaScript for the website.
Profit.
