(This code sucks and was written like three years ago)

This program was made for windows and for a 2560x1440 monitor with a decent computer. Withen minecraft you must also have a certain type of farm and be using a certain texture pack. It will most likely not work for you.

Features:

OCR to detect your position and move based on that.
Random actions to simulate human behavior.
Color detection to detect disconects and rejoin and to prevent getting stuck.
Records at 5 fps for debugging/seeing uptime
Decent logging, no log file yet but the terminal output gives a good idea whats going on.


Why its better than most other autofarmers.

Its written in python so unlike most autofarmers which are in java and actually get the position of blocks/the player every tick this just uses the screen so it makes it (hopefully) very very hard to detect, and certainly harder to detect than the java mods. It also has features that has it take breaks from farming to simulate humans having to go to the bathroom/do something beside farm.
