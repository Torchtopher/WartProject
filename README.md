This project was made beacuase I wanted more resources in Minecraft. It is made in python. It is still being worked on and plenty of new features are on the way. This program was made for windows and for a 2560x1440 monitor with a decent computer. Withen minecraft you must also have a certain type of farm and be using a certain texture pack. It will most likely not work for you but thats ok.

Features:

OCR to detect your position and move based on that.
Random actions to simulate human behavior.
Color detection to detect disconects and rejoin and to prevent getting stuck.
Records at 5 fps for debugging/seeing uptime
Decent logging, no log file yet but the terminal output gives a good idea whats going on.

Installing:

Don't, there are probably 3 people who would actually benift from this. The repo is just for version control and sharing with friends. 

TODO:

Add website with login, make it look really nice. Make it connected with the bot so you can semi control it from the website.
Use the OCR on your invetory to see how much you have farmed.
Add more random actions (Mouse actions)
Make code async/write it better.
Add the feature to make sure its farming, and if its not take action.
Make discord bot connected with all this, to notify me when it goes offline/gets disconnected
Make some cool graphs of how much the bot farmed.
Learn JavaScript for the website.
Profit.
